# Arxivum FrontEnd
This repository contains the code for the frontend of the Arxivum project. It is used along with the [Arxivum Backend](https://github.com/bertofer/arxivum-api).

## Features
This frontend allows the administrator:
- Invite new users to the platform
- Upload, modify name, delete files
- Create, modify name, delete folders
- All other normal users features

Users features:
- Download files that the admin uploaded
- Stream multimedia files while downloading
- Change password

## Technologies
This project uses [Angular4](https://github.com/angular/angular) and has been initialized with [Angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Unfortunately, the webpack config needed to be [extracted](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/1656) because it was needed to include crypto-browserify. This means there is no `ng start`, but `npm run start`, and the individual dependencies of the webpack config are also found on the package.json

It also uses the [NGRX suite](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) to handle state management, and [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) for data transformation, usually in reducers but can be found elsewhere.

## Deploy
To deploy in local environment, just run `npm start`. Make sure you have an API and Tracker from the backend, as the `environment.ts` looks like (Or just change env variables to whatever):
- `api_url: process.env.API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api/'`
- `tracker_url: process.env.TRACKER_URL || 'http://localhost:4000/tracker/'`

You can also run `npm build` to build the artifacts to deploy.

## Docker compatibility
There is a docker image to deploy this frontend, too. But because of the needed customization of the parameters of the Backend, this image first builds the artifacts, and then redeploys. It is useful for quick test iterations, or if you don't mind rebuilding each time you deploy, but might not be the best option for big infrastructures.
